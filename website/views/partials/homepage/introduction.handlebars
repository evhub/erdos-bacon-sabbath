  <h2>An open-source celebration of creative academics &amp; academic creatives</h2>
  <p>
    The Erdős-Bacon-Sabbath number combines three measures of professional collaboration to make a fun (if rather complicated) parlour game for the internet age. If you can find someone who has published academically, been involved in a movie or TV show, and publicly performed a song, they may have an EBS number. The question is, how many degrees of seperation does it take to connect them to mathematican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdős</a>, actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a>, and rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>?</p>
  <p>This website celebrates those multitalented people whose accomplishments span three or more fields of research and creative expression. They turn out to be more numerous than you might think!</p>
